    <h1>What is this website about?</h1>
    <p>This website is about celebrating Halloween. Halloween is a holiday where people dress up as different things, and trick-or-treat for candy. Halloween is also scary-themed, with things such as vampires, ghosts, skeletons, and much more. People also carve faces on pumpkins and light them up to use as decoration(called jack-o-lanterns). On this website, there is a page with spooky stories and a page with costume ideas.</p>
